This study is a project that will be used for our VTOL vehicle, which detects collapsed buildings in the region after an earthquake and creates a road map for the location of this building. My work in this part of our project includes the detection and naming of roads and intersections in the visual so that the segmented and road masked images can be used in creating a target road plan.

## Requirements
- An image segmentation model developed for road detection
- Black and white mask datasets obtained with this model
- Any code editor and development tools for python code
- Python libraries:
